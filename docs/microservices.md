## Microservices for Next Step Project

**Microservices:**

1. **User Management Service:**
    - Handles base user functionality and inheritance hierarchy
    - Manages both Student and Institution user types
    - **Key Features:**
        - User authentication and authorization
        - Student profile management (extends User)
        - Institution management (extends User)
        - Role-based access control
        - Profile relationships

2. **Education Service:**
    - Manages educational data (streams, courses, careers)
    - Provides course and career information
    - Handles educational path mapping
    - **Key Features:**
        - Course management
        - Stream information
        - Career path data
        - Educational requirements

3. **Recommendation Engine Service:**
    - Core AI functionality, analyzes student data, retrieves relevant educational data and generates career path recommendations with probabilities.
    - This service can be a separate microservice consuming data from User Management, Student Profile, and Education Data services.

4. **Frontend Service:**
    - React application acts as the user interface, fetching data and displaying recommendations from various microservices through APIs.

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Simplified architecture with fewer services
- Better data consistency for user-related entities
- Reduced inter-service communication
- Clearer domain boundaries
- Easier deployment and maintenance

**Additional Considerations:**

* **API Gateway:** Implement an API Gateway to manage requests and route them to the appropriate microservices.
* **Data Consistency:**  Use asynchronous communication and eventually consistent data patterns to manage data updates across services.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging for each service to troubleshoot potential issues.

**Alternative Approach:**

While the above is a good starting point, you might consider combining Student Profile and Education Data into a single service depending on the size and complexity of the data. This can simplify architecture for smaller projects.

**Remember:**

* Start with clear boundaries between services based on functionalities.
* Refine your architecture as your application evolves.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured and maintainable microservices architecture for your educational path recommendation system.
